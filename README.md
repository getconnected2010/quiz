A full stack quiz app that uses React, Redux, Express & Mysql. A user with Admin status creates questions with multiple choice answers. These are stored in a mysql database. When same/another user is ready to take a quiz, those questions are populated and displayed with multiple choice answers. After submitting answers, a score is automatically calculated, recoreded in database and displayed on front end as well.
Database has mysql database with three tables. First table to store usernames, passwords and a four digit code to retrive lost passwords. Second table holds usernames that have been flagged for incorrect login credential entries. Third table holds quiz scores of each user catagorized by quiz subject area. Last table holds all the questions and answers catagorized by subject area.
Backend is built on express. There are five quiz related api and 11 user related api routes. Each route has multiple middleware. JWT tokens through access and refresh cookies are used to authenticate and authorize access to api. Express-validator middleware validates and sanitizes incoming inputs before other middlewares handle the end points.
React frontend uses axios, redux, jwt, react-cookie, formik, yup, react-modal, etc as dependency libraries. All backend api is reached through axios. User is persisted throug the app using react-cookie. Redux maintains all quiz and user related states. Formik and Yup are used for user input. React-modal is user for all Alerts.
